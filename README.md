# DataScience_Portfolio

- 👋🏾 Welcome to my Projects!

My Portfolio is divided up into two sections:
1. 🤏🏾Mini-projects which highlight my individual data science skills
2. 🐘Larger projects which highlight my ability to integrate concepts

Each project (be it mini or large) aims to showcase four overall skills:
- Data wrangling
- Data Pre-processing
- Data Visualization 
- Model Creation

I hope the viewing of my portfolio is mutually beneficial!
👀 Enjoy
