🙋🏾‍♂️Hi there!

Welcome to the snapshot of my first major project!

The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jbomitchell/test-match-declarations

As an avid sports fan, i found this dataset of particular interest to me personally🏏
Wouldn't you love to know if your team will win, lose, or draw their test match if they declare in the third innings? Well, I attempted to build a predictive model to do just that.

Three models (Logistic Regression, Random Forrest Sampling, and Decision Trees) were created after some data exploration, visualization and preparation
